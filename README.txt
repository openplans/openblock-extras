==========================
OpenBlock: Extra Packages
==========================

These are open-source packages originally released by the
EveryBlock.com team in 2009, but not actively used or maintained by
the OpenBlock core developers as of 2011.

Everything you actually want is probably in the
`main OpenBlock packages <http://openblockproject.org/docs/packages/>`_.

More information is in the docs/ directory.
