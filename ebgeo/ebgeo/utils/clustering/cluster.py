    Clusters objects into bunches within a buffer by a given radius.

    Differs from k-means clustering in that the number of bunches is
    not known before the program is run or given as an argument: a
    "natural" number of bunches is returned, depending on whether a
    point falls within a buffer. The number of bunches is inversely
    proportional to the size of the buffer: the larger the buffer,
    the fewer number of bunches (but the larger the number of points
    contained in each bunch).

    Similar to k-means clustering in that it calculates a new center
    point for each bunch on each iteration, eventually arriving at
    a steady state.

    I'm just calling it 'buffer clustering': this may be called
    something else for real and there may be a better implementation,
    but I don't know better!

    ``objects`` is a dict with keys for ID some domain object, and 
    the values being 2-tuples representing their points on a 
    coordinate system.
